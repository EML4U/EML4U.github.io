	abstract     = {Collections of text documents such as product reviews and microblogs often evolve over time. In practice, however, classifiers trained on them are updated infrequently, leading to performance degradation over time.While approaches for automatic drift detection have been proposed, they were often designed for low-dimensional sensor data, and it is unclear how well they perform for state-of-the-art text classifiers based on high-dimensional document embeddings. In this paper, we empirically compare drift detectors on document embeddings on two benchmarking datasets with varying amounts of drift. Our results show that multivariate drift detectors based on the Kernel Two-Sample Test and Least-Squares Density Difference outperform univariate drift detectors based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Moreover, our experiments show that current drift detectors perform better on smaller embedding dimensions.}

	abstract     = {Many of today's decision making systems deployed in the real world are not static---they are changing and adapting over time, a phenomenon known as model adaptation takes place. Because of their wide reaching influence and potentially serious consequences, the need for transparency and interpretability of AI-based decision making systems is widely accepted and thus have been worked on extensively---e.g. a very prominent class of explanations are contrasting explanations which try to mimic human explanations. However, usually, explanation methods assume a static system that has to be explained. Explaining non-static systems is still an open research question, which poses the challenge how to explain model differences, adaptations and changes. In this contribution, we propose and (empirically) evaluate a general framework for explaining model adaptations and differences by contrasting explanations. We also propose a method for automatically finding regions in data space that are affected by a given model adaptation---i.e. regions where the internal reasoning of the other (e.g. adapted) model changed---and thus should be explained. Finally, we also propose a regularization for model adaptations to ensure that the internal reasoning of the adapted model does not change in an unwanted way.}
